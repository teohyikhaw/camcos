    "This method works by approximating the joint probability distribution of X_1 and X_2 as a binomial distribution, where in the binomial distibtion, the x parameter is lambda_1 (from X_1), the n parameter is lambda_1+lambda_2, and the p parameter is n_1/(n_1+n_2) This test finds the p-value corresponding to the ratio lambda_1/lambda_2, the reasoning being that if the ratio is large, then that means lambda 1 is larger than lambda 2 (and thus that variance of the pre EIP gas price is larger than the variance of the post EIP gas price) to a statistically significant degree. Hence, we perform a \"greater than\" binomial test to determine of the if the variance is smaller in the post EIP framework.\n",
